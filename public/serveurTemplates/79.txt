Models de communication
	- Device to device
		- 2 or more devices directly connected to each other
		- exemple : home automation, small data packets
		- protocols : Bluetooth, Z-Wave or Zigbee
	- Device to cloud
		- device connected to internet
		- ethernet or wi-fi, IP netowrk
		- remotley access the device via a smartphone or web interface
		- exemple: smart thermostat, smart TV
	- Device to gateway
		- intermedaire to provide security
		- exemple: Fitness tracker, connected to the phone which is a act as a gateway


3 Key factors for a device
	- Range
	- Data rate / bandwith
	- Power consumption (the range and bandwith are high, the more it consume battery)

LPWA Devices
	- Low power, battery operate for years
	- long Range Communication (2-5km for Urban, 10+ for Rural)
	- Technologies:
		- sigfox (oldest)
		- NB-IOT (3G and 4G)
		- LoRa (robustness against interferance, low cost chirp spread spectrum modulations, used, global commercial use)

LoRa
	- physical layer that translate data into a RF signal
	- LoRaWAN is a software protoco that utilizes the LoRa pysical layer
		- defines the structure of a data package and it defines the way packets are processec in the server
		- describes how the messages are encrypted
